# Claim: Situational Engagement Engine

We claim the original design and concept for a screen-based engagement engine that activates in real-world scenarios (e.g. crowd control, civic prompts) using computer vision or triggers to promote order or constructive behavior. This is an original system behavior model integrating social utility into OS logic.
