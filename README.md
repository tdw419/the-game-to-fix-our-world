# The Game to Fix Our World

**The Game to Fix Our World** is an open-source project that invites people to become co-creators in restoring, rebuilding, and reimagining the systems that shape our lives—both digital and physical.

This is not just software. It's a story. A challenge. A mission. And you're invited to play.

---

## Project Vision

We believe the world is worth fixing—and that anyone can help.

Through a series of interactive, modular tools, this project aims to:
- Reclaim personal and public agency in the digital realm
- Make data management and backup visual, accessible, and resilient
- Build a new class of operating system driven by compression, creativity, and stewardship

## Core Modules

### 1. **Pixel Vault**
A visual backup utility that compresses and stores files as pixel-based images—making data tangible, efficient, and portable.

### 2. **Pixelated OS**
A visual-first operating environment where every application, file, and action exists as an image and interaction.

### 3. **The Stewardship Trust**
A trust-based system for organizing collaboration, ownership, and digital responsibility.

### 4. **The Global Pixelated Dictionary**
A universal compression and meaning system that maps concepts and files into visual patterns.
